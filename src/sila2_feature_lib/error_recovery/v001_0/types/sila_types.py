class RecoverableError(sila.CustomDataType):
    """
    Describes an error that can be recovered by error handling. It contains error information (such
    as the command execution during which the error occurred, the time when the error occurred and
    the description of the error situation) and a list of possible continuation options. One of the
    continuation options can be marked as default option. A timeout can be specified for the
    automatic execution of that option if the client doesn't send a continuation option during the
    specified duration.

    .. parameter:: Unique identifier of the error type

    .. parameter:: The fully qualified identifier of the command whose execution produced the error.

    .. parameter:: The UUID of the observable command execution during which the error occurred.

    .. parameter:: The point in time when the error occurred.

    .. parameter:: This message describes the error situation. It should contain the reason of the
    error and additional error handling explanation.

    .. parameter:: A list of possible options to recover the error and continue the command
    execution.

    .. parameter:: The identifier of a continuation option that is marked as the preferred option.
    It must be an identifier of one of the elements of the "Continuation Options" list. It can also
    be defined to be automatically selected by the client after a timeout specified by the
    "Automatic Selection Timeout" element.

    .. parameter:: Specifies a timeout for handling the error by the client. If the user does not
    select a continuation option within the specified duration, the client shall select the defined
    default option automatically. A value of 0 means, that no automatic selection shall be done by
    the client.
